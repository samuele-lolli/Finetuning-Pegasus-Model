        "## Introduction\n",
        "The goal of this notebook is to generate coherent summaries from news articles.\n",
        "To perform this task, we started from a model known as PEGASUS and developed by Google.\n",
        "Quoting Google's research blog on PEGASUS (you can read more [here](https://blog.research.google/2020/06/pegasus-state-of-art-model-for.html)):\n",
        "> «In PEGASUS pre-training, some whole sentences are removed from the documents and the model is tasked with retrieving them. An example input for pre-training is a document with missing sentences, while the output consists of the missing sentences concatenated together. [...] A challenging task like that encourages the model to learn about language and general facts about the world, as well as how to distill information taken from throughout a document in order to generate output that closely resembles the fine-tuning summarization task.»\n",
        "\n",
        "With that being said, we can say that Pegasus is not really pre-trained for summarization tasks, but for very similar ones that allow the model to already have good performance in generating summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "After some testing with the large model, it was evident that many times the model is not that accurate in a specific task like this. For instance, in some tests it wasn't able to compose a summary that really contains the core of the argument and also couldn't really adapt to produce brief summaries. If a summary length that is considered \"too short\" by the model is specified, it often truncates sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we decided to try to fine tune the model on a very small part of the well-known CNN/DailyMail dataset ([here you can find some more informations] (https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail)).\n",
        "\n",

            "Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.\n",
            "Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.\n",
            "And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.\n",
            "Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\n",
            "Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\n",
            "Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\n",
            "Media playback is not supported on this device\n",
            "Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\n",
            "As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\n",
            "Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\n",
            "So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\n",
            "Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\n",
            "It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\n",
            "Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\n",
            "He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\n",
            "This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\n",
            "He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\n",
            "But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\n",
            "That may not be a concern much longer.\n",
            "Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\n",
            "In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\n",
            "Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\n",
            "And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\n",

            "But the latest Cinderella is bucking the trend - and seemingly appealing to audiences as a result.\n",
            "Directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken $70m (Â£43.1m) on its opening weekend in the United States.\n",
            "Yet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending.\n",
            "British actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.\n",
            "\"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.\n",
            "\"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.\n",
            "\"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.\n",
            "\"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.\n",
            "\"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\"\n",
            "Helena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\".\n",
            "\"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'\n",
            "\"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\"\n",
            "Just as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\".\n",
            "But James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\".\n",
            "\"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.\n",
            "\"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\"\n",
            "This is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says.\n",
            "\"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.\n",
            "\"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\"\n",
            "James has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\".\n",
            "Cate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.\n",
            "\"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\"\n",
            "Branagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.\n",
            "\"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.\n",
            "\"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.\n",

            "A 1,200lb-man forced to move from his financially-troubled nursing home was hoisted from the building by a crane and driven to his new residence on a flatbed truck. Robert Butler, 43, was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston. He was accompanied by his medical team. The operation took almost seven hours on Sunday and involved the Providence and Cranston fire departments, Lifespan, the Hospital Association of Rhode Island and Bay Crane Northeast. Scroll down for video . Robert Butler was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston on Sunday after his nursing home shut down amid financial difficulties. In this 2009 image, he weighed 900lbs. He has since gained another 300lbs . The Rhode Island health department acquired a crane from Bay Crane Northeast to help with their operation . Mr Butler was moved to his new hospital resident in a shipping container alongside his medical team to monitor his health . According to Target 12, the complex operation began with firefighters widening the door of Butler's room, then building a special ramp to move Mr Butler on to a deck. He was then shifted into the shipping container, complete with medical equipment, and lifted with a crane down on to a flatbed truck. Michael Raia of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health & Human Services said planning for the move began weeks ago. Mr Raia said the new facility is better equipped to help Butler. In 2006, Mr Butler, who is on permanent disability, told local news channels that his bed was broken  at the nursing home and he was not receiving proper care. At the time, he weighed 900lbs and was trying to find a doctor to perform a gastric bypass and a way to cover the cost of the medical bills. He told WPRI that his weight problem was linked to his depression and that he was addicted to food. The crane was used to hoist Mr Butler in a medically-equipped shipping container from the nursing home on to a flatbed truck on Sunday afternoon . Mr Butler weighs around 1,200lb after a decade of battling his weight which he linked to depression . Mr Butler said in an interview in 2006 (pictured) that he was desperate for a gastric bypass but was unable to find a doctor to perform the surgery. At the time he weight 900lb . \n",
